# 🧠 AI/ML Learning Repository

Welcome to my personal repository where I document and organize everything I learn in **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Core Python**.

This repo is a growing collection of:

- 📘 Python fundamentals and best practices  
- 📊 Data manipulation with **NumPy**, **Pandas**  
- 📈 Visualization using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**  
- 🤖 Machine Learning with **Scikit-learn**  
- 🔥 Deep Learning with **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**  
- 📐 Mathematical foundations for ML (Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability, etc.)

## 🚀 What's Inside

- Well-structured notebooks and scripts  
- Hands-on examples and mini-projects  
- Notes and explanations for quick reference  
- Regular updates as I explore new libraries and concepts

## 📌 Goal

To build a solid foundation in AI/ML and share my learning journey in a way that helps others too.
